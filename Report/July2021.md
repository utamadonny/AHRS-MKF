## Problem
- Madgwick Data Order
- Matlab vs Arduino (real-time) performance different
---

### Data Order Madgwick Filter
Sensor i used is bno055 and behave in NED-Frame(Y-axis = North, X-axis= East, and Z-axis is + in down). But, when i give input to Madgwick filter using bno055 9DoF, i get wrong angle feed.

In this commit [#eb17e67](https://github.com/utamadonny/AHRS-MKF/commit/eb17e676fad8fe55c2dfc3bacd84859643d4dd58), i switch some axis and invert it, so the madgwick filter [(arduino-library)](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MadgwickAHRS) can output euler angle the same as NED-Frame from bno055.

### Matlab vs Arduino Performance
So, i switched some axis in arduino code. Ofc, when to simulate 9DoF data in Matlab i must switch some angle in matlab code, this is done is this commit [#26d52b2](https://github.com/utamadonny/AHRS-MKF/commit/26d52b23af50059704210d309e35adad32678fec#diff-b22a223d974a24ae15da381cedb42fb4e449567f91a2534f64609d6708c690df).
However, when i tuned the filter in Matlab with parameter, SamplePeriod = 1/512 and Beta = 0.1, which is the same as Arduino code. I get delay result.

This delay can be tuned by increasing SamplePeriod or Beta in Matlab Code but it'll be diffent from arduino code.

The second picture have parameter such below:
Arduino : SamplePerod = 1/512 and Beta =0.1
Matlab : SamplePeriod = 1/512 and Beta =1.2
